It was the precursor to the All Terrain Scout Transport seen during the Galactic Civil War.`,\r\n        vehicleImgSrc:`https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_atrtwalker_01_169_dc4f22ad.jpeg`,\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport default VehicleImage;"],"mappings":"AAAA,GAAM,CAAAA,YAAY,CAAG,CACjB,CACIC,IAAI,eAAe,CACnBC,WAAW,2OAA2O,CACtPC,aAAa,0EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,iBAAiB,CACrBC,WAAW,6iBAA8hB,CACziBC,aAAa,sFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,mBAAmB,CACvBC,WAAW,krBAA8pB,CACzqBC,aAAa,qEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,qBAAqB,CACzBC,WAAW,meAAme,CAC9eC,aAAa,qEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,cAAc,CAClBC,WAAW,qiBAAqiB,CAChjBC,aAAa,qEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,aAAa,CACjBC,WAAW,mNAAmN,CAC9NC,aAAa,yEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,QAAQ,CACZC,WAAW,iTAAiT,CAC5TC,aAAa,+DACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,QAAQ,CACZC,WAAW,0iBAA0iB,CACrjBC,aAAa,qEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,8BAA8B,CAClCC,WAAW,oXAA0W,CACrXC,aAAa,8EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,aAAa,CACjBC,WAAW,8kBAA+jB,CAC1kBC,aAAa,wFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,wBAAwB,CAC5BC,WAAW,syBAAiyB,CAC5yBC,aAAa,+DACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,qBAAqB,CACzBC,WAAW,gPAAgP,CAC3PC,aAAa,2EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,wBAAwB,CAC5BC,WAAW,8XAA8X,CACzYC,aAAa,uEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,gBAAgB,CACpBC,WAAW,6oBAA6oB,CACxpBC,aAAa,sFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,wBAAwB,CAC5BC,WAAW,+oBAA+oB,CAC1pBC,aAAa,6EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,uBAAuB,CAC3BC,WAAW,6XAA6X,CACxYC,aAAa,wFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,iCAAiC,CACrCC,WAAW,mXAAmX,CAC9XC,aAAa,8EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,uBAAuB,CAC3BC,WAAW,4VAA4V,CACvWC,aAAa,oGACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,kBAAkB,CACtBC,WAAW,+mBAA+mB,CAC1nBC,aAAa,8FACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,eAAe,CACnBC,WAAW,oiBAAoiB,CAC/iBC,aAAa,qFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,sBAAsB,CAC1BC,WAAW,yPAAyP,CACpQC,aAAa,mFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,6BAA6B,CACjCC,WAAW,wZAAwZ,CACnaC,aAAa,uEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,kBAAkB,CACtBC,WAAW,uZAA+Y,CAC1ZC,aAAa,0EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,SAAS,CACbC,WAAW,snBAAsnB,CACjoBC,aAAa,sFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,SAAS,CACbC,WAAW,2+BAA2+B,CACt/BC,aAAa,yFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,QAAQ,CACZC,WAAW,w2BAAw2B,CACn3BC,aAAa,oEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,OAAO,CACXC,WAAW,qRAAqR,CAChSC,aAAa,mGACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,mBAAmB,CACvBC,WAAW,gdAAic,CAC5cC,aAAa,8EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,qBAAqB,CACzBC,WAAW,oWAAoW,CAC/WC,aAAa,mFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,wBAAwB,CAC5BC,WAAW,6ZAAmZ,CAC9ZC,aAAa,2EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,8BAA8B,CAClCC,WAAW,ktBAAwsB,CACntBC,aAAa,sEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,wBAAwB,CAC5BC,WAAW,qFAAqF,CAChGC,aAAa,uEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,oBAAoB,CACxBC,WAAW,gpBAAgpB,CAC3pBC,aAAa,yFACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,wBAAwB,CAC5BC,WAAW,mlBAEiX,CAC5XC,aAAa,8EACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,8BAA8B,CAClCC,WAAW,oOAAoO,CAC/OC,aAAa,uEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,mBAAmB,CACvBC,WAAW,qOAAqO,CAChPC,aAAa,2FACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,gCAAgC,CACpCC,WAAW,wYAAwY,CACnZC,aAAa,2FACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,gBAAgB,CACpBC,WAAW,qZAAqZ,CAChaC,aAAa,uEACjB,CAAC,CACD,CACIF,IAAI,QAAQ,CACZC,WAAW,qhBAAqhB,CAChiBC,aAAa,oFACjB,CAAC,CACJ,CAED,cAAe,CAAAH,YAAY"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
