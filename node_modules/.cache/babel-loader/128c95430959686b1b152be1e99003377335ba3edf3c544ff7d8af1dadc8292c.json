During the Clone Wars, the Jedi attempted to defend Felucia from those who would exploit the planet.`,\r\n        imageSrc:'https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_felucia_01_169_2070e38e.jpeg',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name:'Cato Neimoidia',\r\n        description:`A weathly Neimoidian colony world, Cato Neimoidia's jewelled palaces and opulent bridge-cities were the pride and joy of Trade Federation barons, who sought constantly to one-up each other and dazzle guests with displays of ostentatious hospitality and luxury living.`,\r\n        imageSrc:'https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/databank_catoneimoidia_01_169_d2b9bb58.jpeg',\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        name:'Saleucami',\r\n        description:`A world of mixed terrain, from dank, swampy environments marked with strange bulbous plant-life, to arid deserts, Saleucami is an Outer Rim planet that remained untouched by the Clone Wars through most of the fighting.
